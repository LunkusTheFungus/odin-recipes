    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mofongo is a Puerto Rican dish made with crispy green plantains mashed with garlic, olive oil, and pork rinds (or bacon). Mofongo goes well with chicken, or you can stuff it with shrimp, pork, or octopus salad. Form into large balls and serve as-is, or form into small balls and drop into hot broth or soup.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups canola oil for frying</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>one eighth cup crushed fried pork skins</li>
        <li>2 green plantains, peeled and sliced into half-inch rounds</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat canola oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mash garlic with olive oil in a mortar and pestle. Combine garlic mixture with pork rinds in a large bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Fry plantain chunks until golden and crispy, but not brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer fried plantains into the bowl with garlic mixture; toss to coat and mash with the pestle until smooth. Season with salt.</li>
